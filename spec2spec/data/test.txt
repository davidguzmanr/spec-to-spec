LJ050-0163|the Secret Service should attempt to develop a system compatible with those of the agencies from which most of its data will come. Note:
LJ018-0391|Mr. Bamell Oakley made a rich harvest for a time, and was said at the time of his trial
LJ039-0117|He had the services of an experienced highly trained coach.
LJ015-0070|whence he passed to a better position under the Crystal Palace Company.
LJ007-0198|The windows were to be glazed and painted to prevent prisoners from looking out;
LJ002-0284|The Borough Compter was in a disgraceful state to the last. The men's ward had an earth, or rather a mud, floor,
LJ045-0114|Oswald also said that he did not want the FBI to know where he lived, quote, Because their visits were not very pleasant for him
LJ041-0198|His use of those excuses to present himself to the world as a person who was being unfairly treated
LJ017-0024|and as Fenning, although convicted and executed, protested her innocence in the most solemn manner to the last,
LJ031-0196|Detailed security arrangements had been made by radio from the President's plane on the return flight.
LJ041-0190|It got him in the newspapers. It did broadcast his name out, end quote.
LJ024-0070|I now propose that we establish by law an assurance against any such ill-balanced court in the future.
LJ018-0168|but proofs of Griffiths' guilt were at once apparent on entering his work-room.
LJ002-0292|the master's side, the cabin side, and the common side. Payment of a fee of three shillings gained the debtor admission to the two first named;
LJ039-0177|was greater than from the second to the third shot and required a movement in the basic firing position of the marksmen.
LJ040-0171|where he did as he wanted and he didn't have to live by any rules or come into contact with people, end quote.
LJ015-0236|Burgess admitted him into the guard's van, where he fitted and filed the keys till they worked easily and satisfactorily in the locks of the safe.
LJ018-0325|But extra precautions and close supervision have so far proved effectual, and the prisoners are still in custody after a lapse of ten years.
LJ026-0017|their nutritive processes result in oxidation, they have a definite organ of excretion and are capable of automatic movement
LJ018-0195|His regular trade, followed before he took to the life of resurrectionist, was that of an engraver.
LJ040-0234|for some reason the record does not show, advantage was never taken of the chance afforded to Oswald.
LJ040-0038|Such ideas of grandeur were apparently accompanied by notions of oppression.
LJ047-0115|Several days later, the Bureau received additional evidence that Oswald had lied to Agent Quigley.
LJ014-0287|He had been led to suppose that twelve months' imprisonment was the utmost the law could inflict, and he broke down utterly under the unexpected blow.
LJ025-0119|from the metamorphosis of morphological units (termed cells in a more general sense than that in which the word "cells" was at first employed),
LJ008-0300|The prisoners and their friends, therefore, were kept in a state of the most violent suspense for many hours,
LJ006-0253|the signal for the commencement of obscene talk, revelry, and violence.
LJ010-0065|At the former the "Provisional Government" was to be established,

LJ046-0127|or from the occasional investigations initiated by the Secret Service,
LJ027-0171|the highest order (anoura) of this class. Thus, then, in ontogeny the fish goes no further than the fish stages.
LJ046-0071|The Secret Service and the Federal, State, and local law enforcement agencies which cooperate with it,
LJ003-0227|So unjust and unequal was the system, that the allowance to convicted criminals was better than that of the innocent debtor,
LJ019-0098|and the question was once more taken up in the House of Commons. In eighteen forty-nine Mr. Charles Pearson, M.P.,
LJ010-0223|You must attend; and if your master will not give you leave, you must come in defiance of him.
LJ010-0041|or like Cannon the chimney-sweeper, who savagely killed the policeman.
LJ035-0192|Although Oswald probably left the building at about twelve:thirty-three p.m., his absence was not noticed until at least one-half hour later.
LJ018-0032|There was no mystery about his departure; he had gone to Canada, by the 'Victoria' sailing ship, starting from the London docks, and bound to New York.
LJ035-0201|The fact that Truly found Fritz in the northwest corner of the floor, near the point where the rifle was found, supports Fritz' recollection.
LJ040-0226|I couldn't in all honesty sincerely say such a thing.
LJ030-0118|In the downtown area, large crowds of spectators gave the President a tremendous reception.
LJ013-0197|Mr. Phillips, who led in the case, went to the other extreme,
LJ018-0142|By this time Brown alone had stolen three or four hundred sheets,
LJ019-0271|In a word, the value of diet as a part of penal discipline was still insufficiently recognized.
LJ020-0009|Three cups of lukewarm water in which the potatoes were boiled, strained through a coarse cloth.
LJ048-0078|In each instance, liaison contacts should be developed to include a close friendly relationship,
LJ012-0178|Thurtell drove him down in a gig, "to be killed as he traveled," in Thurtell's own words.
LJ033-0045|At approximately nine p.m., after the children had been put to bed, Mrs. Paine, according to her testimony before the Commission, quote,
LJ047-0224|In fact, Hosty participated in transmitting to the Secret Service two pieces of information pertaining to the visit.

LJ034-0007|The Commission evaluated the physical evidence found near the window after the assassination and the testimony of eyewitnesses
LJ018-0080|Sattler was tried for murder and convicted;
LJ023-0043|I want to talk with you very simply about the need for present action in this crisis
LJ021-0180|to issue new bonds therefore bearing only three and one half percent interest,
LJ050-0207|Although Chief Rowley does not complain about the pay scale for Secret Service agents,
LJ004-0184|There reigned through the whole edifice a chilly, damp, unwholesome atmosphere, and the effluvia from the prisoners was so nauseous
LJ033-0081|she looked out the breakfast-room window and saw Oswald cross the street and walk toward the driveway where her brother parked his car near the carport.
LJ029-0121|and that the wide streets that we would use downtown would be of sufficient width to keep the public out of our way.
LJ038-0177|A note which Oswald left for his wife on the evening of the shooting,
LJ016-0240|This generally produces instantaneous death, although cases where complete fracture of the spinal cord occurred are said to be rare.
LJ007-0066|on the other, the governor of the jail sneered at his zeal
LJ004-0137|and that it was accomplished by "sleeping edgewise."
LJ035-0069|Baker placed himself on a motorcycle about two hundred feet from the corner of Elm and Houston Streets where he said he heard the shots.

LJ001-0071|Most of Caxton's own types are of an earlier character, though they also much resemble Flemish or Cologne letter.
LJ015-0203|but were the precautions too minute, the vigilance too close to be eluded or overcome?

LJ032-0004|were fired from the southeast corner window of the sixth floor of the Texas School Book Depository Building
LJ006-0040|The fact was that the years as they passed, nearly twenty in all, had worked but little permanent improvement in this detestable prison.
LJ037-0243|Westbrook walked through the parking lot behind the service station and found a light-colored jacket lying under the rear of one of the cars.
LJ047-0149|the New Orleans office of the FBI learned that in September Oswald had given a forwarding address of two five one five
LJ031-0181|onto the rear of the Presidential plane where seats had been removed to make room.

LJ014-0074|One fine afternoon in August, O'Connor was met walking in the direction of Bermondsey.
LJ046-0087|Absolute security is neither practical nor possible. An approach to complete security would require the President
LJ018-0029|A photograph of Müller shown the jeweler was identified as the likeness of the man who had exchanged Mr. Briggs' chain.
LJ048-0026|He gave evidence of settling down.
LJ006-0217|There were more varied, and at times, especially when beer had circulated freely, more uproarious diversions.
LJ041-0171|And I remember his voice cracked as he said this. He was definitely disturbed at what I had said and I didn't really think I had said that much.
LJ050-0211|Chief Rowley testified that the present workload of each Secret Service agent averages one hundred ten point one cases.
LJ016-0027|Escape seemed absolutely hopeless,
LJ018-0218|In eighteen fifty-five
LJ013-0257|They were seen together on Barnes Common, and again in Putney Park Lane, where they were talking loud and angrily.
LJ006-0066|In the middle yard it was still worse.
LJ042-0010|it appears that personal and psychological factors were also involved.
LJ006-0204|In the same way the wardsman laid in his stock to be retailed. Other light literature besides the daily journals were in circulation:

LJ041-0115|He was undesirably discharged from the Marine Corps Reserve, to which he had been assigned on inactive status following his transfer from active duty,
LJ002-0143|The commissioners who presided were, quote, little otherwise than self-elected
LJ040-0223|his lack of friends, the apparent unavailability of any agency assistance and the ineffectualness of his mother
LJ007-0061|He left off because he was so much interfered with and laughed at, and from seeing that no success attended his efforts, owing to the evils arising from association.
LJ045-0229|He then killed Patrolman Tippit when that police officer apparently tried to question him after he had left his roominghouse and he vigorously resisted arrest
LJ019-0028|Mr. Shaw-Lefevre, the Speaker of the House of Commons, Sir Benjamin Brodie,
LJ005-0056|It is interesting to observe that the plan of "radiation," by which the prison blocks radiated from a central hall, like spokes in a wheel
LJ016-0285|Then one struck up the hymn of the Promised Land, and the refrain was at once taken up with a mighty chorus --
LJ037-0131|When he reached a gasoline service station one block away he turned north and walked toward a parking area in the rear of the station.

LJ035-0077|He placed the rifle on the floor near the site where Oswald's rifle was actually found after the shooting.
LJ035-0160|Reconstructing her movements, Mrs. Reid ran the distance three times and was timed in two minutes by stopwatch.
LJ028-0413|In his quaint way he says:
LJ047-0052|Having concluded that Oswald was not a security risk or potentially dangerous or violent,
LJ045-0246|He sought for himself a place in history -- a role as the "great man" who would be recognized as having been in advance of his times.
LJ036-0018|where he boarded a bus which was heading back in the direction of the Depository Building, on its way to the Oak Cliff section of Dallas.
LJ018-0146|and he was soon approached by the police. Almost directly he was questioned he made a clean breast of the whole affair.
LJ044-0072|on which Oswald was heard for less than five minutes on August seventeen, nineteen sixty-three.
LJ003-0013|No attempt was made to check drunkenness, beyond the penalty of shutting out friends from any ward in which a prisoner exceeded.
LJ046-0227|According to Special Agent in Charge Bouck,
LJ006-0238|"There was a disturbance in the transport yard yesterday evening, and the police were called in.

LJ016-0399|Wainwright was allowed a cigar the night before execution, which he smoked in the prison yard, walking up and down with the governor, Mr. Sydney Smith.

LJ004-0209|The looms were constantly busy. Tailors were always at work, and every article of clothing and bedding was made up within the walls.

LJ040-0164|The possibility of commitment was to be considered only if the probation plan was not successful.

LJ047-0074|Under a general Bureau request to be on the alert for activities of the Fair Play for Cuba Committee
